    login: "admin"

<!-- # Adding users

to add a new user, you'll have to modify your `my-config.yml` file, by adding the following for each user in the `appConfig>auth>users` section under your own credentials:

    - user: user1
        hash: hashed_password

If you want to make him admin, so you juste have to add this under the hash

    type: admin

so something like that:

    - user: user1
        hash: hashed_password
        type: admin

# Widget

to add some new widgets, you'll have to add it in your `my-config.yml` file, for example, to add a clock:

    - name: Aria Info
        widgets:
            - type: clock
            options:
                timeZone: Europe/London
                format: en-GB
                hideDate: false
